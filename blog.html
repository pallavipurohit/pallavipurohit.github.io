          <h1>What to do if your identity gets stolen</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blgcontent text-justify">
              <p><h5>by Pallavi Purohit</h5><h3>A step-by-step guide on what to do if your identity is stolen.</h3><br>In 2014, the National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India Limited (NCCF) performed a survey of consumer agencies that pointed to identity theft as the fastest-growing complaint they've received. Despite this issue's prevalence and the damage identity thieves can cause, many people aren't sure what to do when they become a victim of this crime. Follow this step-by-step guide on what to do if your identity is stolen<br><br>
              <img class="img-responsive" src="images/identity.jpg" alt="Intel Processors" style="width:70%"><br>
              <h4> Discover the Source</h4>
              Before you can correct the problem, it's important to know the origin of the attack. While traditional identity theft involved criminals "dumpster diving" to obtain personal information such as receipts or credit card bills, thieves are now targeting popular online services. Banking websites, online retailers and even dating sites hold a wealth of consumer information.<br>As soon as you realize you've been victimized, think about your recent online activity. Did you respond to any emails that appeared to be from financial institutions claiming that your account was suspended or under review? Did you download any video players or media files as attachments from senders you didn't know? Have any e-commerce sites you use on a regular basis recently sustained a cyberattack? Any one of these could create a vulnerability to hacking.<br><br>
              <h4>Start Making Calls</h4>
              Once you've discovered the theft, start making calls. Begin with any companies where fraud occurred, such as your credit card issuer or bank. Ask them to close or freeze your accounts, and change all of your login and password information. Next, contact one of the "big three" credit bureaus:<br><br>
              &emsp;• State Bank of India: 1800 11 2211<br> &emsp;• Syndicate Bank: 1800225092 and 18004250585 <br>&emsp;• HDFC Bank: 1800 425 4332<br>
              Ask for a credit report, and have a "fraud alert" placed on your accounts for 90 days. Once you've contacted one of these agencies, they're obligated to inform the other two. Then, report the identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and file a police report with your local law enforcement department.<br><br>
              <h4>Cover Your Bases</h4>
              Private companies and government agencies often act quickly to help you back on track after identify theft when it comes to locking down accounts or issuing new identification. But after the initial storm has passed, you may experience long-term consequences of identity theft—your personal data may be used to file fraudulent tax returns during the next calendar year, or even several years down the line.<br>Make sure to keep a keen eye on your credit reports beyond 90 days, and always flag anything fraudulent immediately. In some grave situations, you can also apply for a new social security number. Additionally, you should try to limit the amount of credit services you use to reduce the long-term impact of identity theft. With only one or two low-limit cards, any other activity will quickly be flagged as suspicious.<br><br>
              <h4> Protect Your Future</h4>
              After criminals have stolen your identity and used it to open fraudulent accounts or make large purchases, you may encounter legal difficulties. Often, defrauded companies will report their losses to private debt collectors, who will call you and your family members looking for the money owed for "your" purchases. In July of 2015, 31 percent of complaints made to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were about debt collectors. Many of these collectors are aggressive. As a result, it's a good idea to contact card issuers, banks and other agencies as soon as you notice a theft and keep records of all relevant phone calls, letters and information requests.<br>In addition to knowing how and when to react, it is important to take preventative measures: Safe Internet surfing habits, solid antivirus and Internet security solutions, effective passwords and limited credit sprawl. And while this all may sound a bit overwhelming, it pays to know what to do if your identity is stolen. The tips above can help mitigate the damage and help you get your life back on track.        <div id="assassin"></div><br></p>

          <h1>Intel’s new High-Powered i9 processors</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blgcontent text-justify">
          <p><h5>by Abhinav Agnihotry</h5><h3>Intel's Core i9 Extreme Edition CPU is an 18-core beast.</h3><br>
              The Intel’s rebranding might sound like a marketing hype, but it’s not. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to cram 18 cores and 36 threads into a single piece of “silicon” that enables the kind of throttled tasks that a world full of 4K video and virtual reality demands. <br><br>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/intel.jpg" alt="Intel Processors" style="width:70%"><br>
           The more cores and threads a single CPU contains, the more dedicated tasks it can manage simultaneously without sacrificing performance. Is an 18-core, 36-thread processor overkill for most people? Sure! But for the right applications, it could be a lifesaver.<br><br> Video and VR isn’t the only use case for Intel’s Rs. 1,10,000 ( $1700 ) monster. Compiling code and running intensive virtual reality experiences could use the boost. And the real benefit goes to those who need to navigate several interrelated tasks at once, like live-streaming video games on Twitch or YouTube. <br><br>
          There are 5 variants of the new processor line namely Core i9-7900X, Core i9-7920X , Core i9-7940X,  Core i9-7960X  and  Core i9-7980X starting from 10cores (20 threads) up to 18core (36 threads).<br><br>
          Recently a well known over-clocker who goes by the online handle Elmor managed to push the processor past the 5.7GHz using liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling. This allowed him to set a pair of benchmark records in Cinebench, at difference clock speeds. Here is a look:<br><br>
          &emsp;• Core i9-7900X @ 5,755MHz: 3,181 points in Cinebench R15<br> &emsp;• Core i9-7900X @ 5,785MHz: 34.79 points in Cinebench R11.5<br><br>Those are the highest scores ever achieved for a 10-core processor, and the fastest outside of server setups. Just wait for the biggest 7980X chip to release as this was just the youngest sibling.<br><br>
           So no, most PC owners today won’t be able to take full advantage of an 18-core, 36-thread beast. But that’s not really the point. Core X exists less for the present than it does for the future, one in which “extreme” becomes normal, because there’s nothing else left.<br></p>

          <h1>Assassin's Creed</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blgcontent text-justify">
          <p><h5>by Praveen Agnihotry</h5><h3> World’s most famous action-adventure video-game franchise.</h3><br>
              Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure franchise which takes inspiration from the real-world historical events. The games in this series are set in different locations around the world and tell a fictional story about how the 'Assassins' and 'Templars' affected the history. The series basically depicts the conflict between two groups, the 'Assassins' and 'Templars'. The Templars desires the world peace through control while the Assassins believe in free will. <br><br>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/assassin.jpg" alt="Assassins creed" style="width:70%"><br>
          &emsp; Up until Assassin's Creed III the story revolves around the character Desmond Miles, who is being used by Abstergo Industries, to reveal the positions of powerful ancient artifacts left by the old civilization. Later in the first assassin's creed game it is revealed that Abstergo Industries is a templar organization and Desmond Miles is a descendent of assassins.<br><br> Abstergo industry uses the 'Animus' to bring out the memories of the ancestors of the one using it. When Desmond gets to know about that he runs away and finds the artifacts and the 'Apple of Eden' himself and later sacrifices his life to save the world from destruction. Later games in the series provide a story about the Abstergo industries' and how they obtain the ancient artifacts and assassins descendents oppose them. <br><br>
          Assassin's creed games are famous for their vast open world and storytelling with Assassin's creed 2 and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag considered critically the best in the series.<br></p><div id="women"></div>

          <h1>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blgcontent text-justify">
          <p><h5>by Pallavi Purohit</h5><h4><b>The topic on “Women Empowerment” is a burning issue all over the world. “Women empowerment” and “women equality with men” is a universal issue.</b></h4><br>
              <h4>What is the meaning of Women Empowerment?</h4>
              Women Empowerment refers to increasing and improving the social, economic, political and legal strength of the women, to ensure equal-right to women, and to make them confident enough to claim their rights, such as:<br><br>
              &emsp;• freely live their life with a sense of self-worth, respect and dignity,<br>
              &emsp;• have complete control of their life, both within and outside of their home and workplace,<br>
              &emsp;• to make their own choices and decisions,<br>
              &emsp;• have equal rights to participate in social, religious and public activities,<br>
              &emsp;• have equal social status in the society,<br>
              &emsp;• have equal rights for social and economic justice,<br>
              &emsp;• determine financial and economic choices,<br>
              &emsp;• get equal opportunity for education,<br>
              &emsp;• get equal employment opportunity without any gender bias,<br>
              &emsp;• get safe and comfortable working environment,
              <br><br>
              <img class="img-responsive" src="images/women.jpg" alt="Bathroon Cabinet" style="width:70%"><br>
              <h4>Why Women Empowerment is Important?</h4>

              <b>Under-employed and unemployed:</b>Women population constitutes around 50% of the world population. A large number of women around the world are unemployed. The world economy suffers a lot because of the unequal opportunity for women at workplaces.
              <br><br>
              <b>Talented:</b>Women are as talented as men. Previously, women were not allowed higher education like men and hence their talents were wasted. But nowadays, they are also allowed to go for higher studies and it encourages women to show their talents which will not only benefit her individually but to the whole world at large.
              <br><br>
              <b>Overall development of society: </b>The main advantage of Women Empowerment is that there will be an overall development of the society. The money that women earn does not only help them and or their family, but it also help develop the society.
              <br><br>
              <b>Economic Benefits: </b>Women Empowerment also leads to more economic benefits not to the individuals but to the society as well. Unlike earlier days when they stayed at home only and do only kitchen stuffs, nowadays, they roam outside and also earns money like the male members of the society. Women empowerment helps women to stand on their own legs, become independent and also to earn for their family which grows country’s economy.
              <br><br>
              <b>Reduction in domestic violence: </b>Women Empowerment leads to decrease in domestic violence. Uneducated women are at higher risk for domestic violence than an educated woman. know their rights and duties and hence can stop corruption.
              <br><br>
              <b>Reduce Poverty: </b>Women Empowerment also reduces poverty. Sometimes, the money earned by the male member of the family is not sufficient to meet the demands of the family. The added earnings of women help the family to come out of poverty trap.
              <br><br>
              <b>National Development: </b>Women are increasingly participating in the national development process. They are making the nation proud by their outstanding performances almost every spheres including medical science, social service, engineering, etc.

          <p><h5>by Tescoliving.com</h5><h3>Get out the door on time with a spring in your step using these quick and easy hacks.</h3><br>
              <h4>Hang your outfit the night before</h4>
              Attach an adhesive hook to your wardrobe door and use it to hang up the following day’s clothes, including all underwear and socks. Get into this evening habit, and you’ll easily save yourself a frantic 10 minutes in the morning rummaging through your wardrobe.<br><br>
              <h4>Wake up energised</h4>
              Wake up on the right side of the bed with the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock app. Just set the alarm for a 30-minute window, and the soothing alarm sounds will only trigger during a light sleep phase so you wake up naturally and feel rested.
              Use it for more than a week, and you’ll begin to see graphs and trends showing sleeping patterns according to days of the weeks, the moon, weather and daily activity.<br><br>
              <h4>Time your morning shower</h4>
              Set an alarm on your phone for a maximum of five minutes to encourage you to quicken the pace. Multi-task by lathering up with body wash while you condition your hair or shave.<br><br>
              <h4>Organise your bathroom</h4>
              Have your daily showering essentials like shampoo, body wash and a razor at arm’s length away for maximum efficiency.<br>
